Hi everyone, my name is Kari. I’m taking this class as part of the web programming certificate program and this is my second year at Macomb. After this semester, I’ll have 3 classes to complete, so I should be done with the program by the end of this year.  In the past I worked in the social services field and earned a BA in Psychology from OU in 2007. I love that I’ve had the opportunity to work toward a career change and have enjoyed all of the classes at MCC so far. On a more personal note, I’m 38, married, and a stay at home mom to 2 energetic boys (ages 2 and 4).
